# Stuff I have gotta do
 - figure out the exact metric that will appear on this graph. I think the metric should be a line
   for each area with the up part being averaged consumption, and the right part being time of day.
 - add code in the model which gets averaged consumption for a given time of day. I also then need
   something along the lines of a static method that averages this up for all consumers in a
   given category. There might already be a function for this under the name fold or something else.
   I will look it up.
 - add tests for these things.

 - make the table and the graph in the summary view. The graph should be at the top obviously.
 - add a detail view for users which maybe graphs their personal data.
